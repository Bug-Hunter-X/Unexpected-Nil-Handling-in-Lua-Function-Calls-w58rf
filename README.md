This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, issue in Lua programming involving implicit nil handling in function calls.  The `bug.lua` file showcases a function that explicitly checks for `nil` arguments, but the behavior when calling the function without arguments might still be unexpected for those unfamiliar with how Lua treats missing parameters. The solution illustrates a clearer approach to handling optional parameters and preventing potential confusion.
